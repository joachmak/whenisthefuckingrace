# When is the f\*cking race?

This small web app fetches F1 season race data from ergast.com and converts each date to local time. It finds the date and time of the next F1 event (be it a practice session, sprint race, quali or race) and displays it while also sprinkling in a set of nice words.

Visit [whenisthefuckingrace.com](https://whenisthefuckingrace.com) to see it in action ;D
